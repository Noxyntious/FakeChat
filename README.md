# FakeChat 
**FakeChat** is a simple program made in C# built to badly simulate a chatting enviroment in a console. It is light, easy to use and effective at its one goal - to make you feel less lonely. It is a replacement for any chatting app if you don't mind the fact **you're not actually chatting with people**. No internet required.
